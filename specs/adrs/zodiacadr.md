# Store all zodiac combination responses locally

## Context and Problem Statement

When the user selects a zodiac pairing, we need to serve them a compatibility response. The issue however is if we should serve them the same response each time or try to give them a different, but similar response each time because getting the same response can be quite boring.

## Considered Options

- One response for all 33 unique combinations
- Make 1 or 2 more custom responses and pick a random one to serve each time
- Use some kind of API (maybe ChatGPT) to deliver a custom response

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: For now we will just stick to using one response for all 33 unique combinations. Considering the time that we have left, adding extra features/complexity to our mini-app is not what we are trying to do. Once we have all 33 unique responses hard coded we can think about adding more or using an API to give us responses. We will reconsider this decision again once we have our mini-app completed and have the opportunity to add extra features.

# Question: How should the user choose their birthdate/zodiac sign

## Context and Problem Statement

The user needs to input their and their partner's zodiac sign for our fortune to output a result. There are a lot of methods of input to choose a zodiac sign or date.

## Decision Drivers

- looks cool
- easy to input
- intuitive to find and navigate
- easily changed from one to the next

## Considered Options

- scrolling on a wheel
  - pros:
    - looks cool
    - feels fortune teller-y
    - very easy to change options
  - cons:
    - hard to implement
    - might not be super intuitive
- clicking on the wheel
  - pros
    - easy for the user to do
  - cons
    - looks less cool
    - not easy to implement
- date input box
  - pros
    - easy to implement
    - intuitive
  - cons
    - does not look cool
    - requires the user to choose a specific date which is unnecessary
    - relatively difficult for the user to choose and change

## Decision Outcome

chosen option: scrolling on a wheel. it looks the coolest and we have time to figure out to how to implement since it's the beginning of the project. We also had to add a faq/tutorial button and page to teach the user how to navigate our page, which turned out to be needed anyways.

# Question: How to indicate to the user that they have chosen a particular sign?

## Context and Problem Statement

the user needs to know that they have successfully chosen a particular sign. How can we indicate to the user or give feedback the sign that they have chosen?

## Decision Drivers

- looks cool
- obvious that it's the sign they have chosen

## Considered Options

- highlights the part of the wheel that they have chosen
  - pros
    - looks the coolest
    - intuitive, obvious feedback
  - cons
    - very difficult to implement
- arrows next to a segment of the wheel that we assign as the choosing part
  - pros
    - easiest to implement
    - intuitive because it points to the wheel
  - cons
    - look less cool
- pop-up image
  - pros
    - looks cool
    - not hard to implement
  - cons
    - not connected to the wheel, not obvious that it's the feedback
    - takes up space

## Decision Outcome

chosen option: arrows next to a segment of the wheel. We didn't want to sacrifice intuitiveness for aesthetic. Given the limited time, we can't afford to spend too much time on one feedback feature. The arrows seems like a good enough option for now.

# Question: What kind of feedback should we provide?

## Context and Problem Statement

after the user has submitted their signs/birthdates, what kind of feedback should we provide? It needs to be something fortune tellers traditionally give and based on their zodiac signs.

## Decision Drivers

- the user is interested in
- given the 33/66/144 combinations of zodiac signs, it needs to be relatively simple to implement

## Considered Options

- let the user choose what types of relationships they have and give according feedback
  - pros
    - more options for the user
  - cons
    - people don't really think of or care enough about anything other than love lives to put them into a fortune teller app
    - does not match our other methods of fortune telling
- simple love-related paragraph feedbacks generated by chatgpt
  - pros
    - interesting enough
    - fits the purpose
  - cons
    - annoying to code
    - a little boring
- generated a random compatibility percentage
  - pros
    - very easy to code and implement
    - fits the purpose
  - cons
    - boring

## Decision Outcome

chosen option: simple love-related paragraph feedbacks generated by chatgpt. It fits our purpose the best and we think the user would want this the most. It's not too difficult to make either.
