Agile session 2 to do list:

MUST FIX/Big Things to Consider/work on:

Implement CI/CD (Jest, Jsdoc, linter, etc) steal group 23’s yaml files
Unit tests and E2E
Make sure we have all the artifacts in our repo (diagrams, all the ADRs, etc.)
Accessibility (+ other ilities)
UI needs an overhaul, a lot of our mini apps look vastly different from one another
Let’s go back and look at our mockup for reference on what our pages should look like
https://www.figma.com/file/HLZcqFseGIGNKKZIjaTLXP/CSE110-Group20?type=design
Consider adding more animations
Let’s remember that our target audience was college students
Maybe make the fortunes more oriented towards the interests of the average college student (romance, grade prediction, etc.)
Remember to write github issues
Repo:
Clean up repo
Remove .vscode folder (.gitignore)
Clean up branches at the end
Move adrs to specs/adrs
minimum of 3 ADRs
See if there’s any files left in the group20 repo that we need to move over since the TAs will be looking at our fortune telling repo for grading

Home Page
Final adjustments to anchoring
Randomize button can highlight a random app and click on it after a few milliseconds

Fortune Cookie:
Animation on opening the cookie and the text pop up appearing
Test some of the inputs through jest/end to end testing
Fortunes should aim to be more relatable with the students (audience)
Make it so you don’t get the same fortune twice in a row

Zodiac Compatibility:
Make the pop up page look nicer
Add accessibility features (text to speech for pairing results)
Give pop up page actual content
indicate which sign the wheel is pointing to/the birthday is (add a pointer or highlighter feature)
Make the choose a relationship button actually work and text visible
Add alternative zodiac selection methods (click to spin) in addition to scroll and date select

#### Undiscussed business for next meeting

None

### Decisions made

Start Agile session 2 at the beginning of week 10

#### Meeting finished at: 12:30pm
